# Django-Mustering-Templates
Requirements

This repository doesn't ship with a django installation. The system must have an existing django installation so that we can safely import required modules. A django app is absolutely not required. Among other requirements is the db backend. If you're planning to use mysql or pgsql - please make sure you have all dependencies met. This code works on Django 1.11.
Application Structure

    settings.py - The Django settings module. Contains the database configuration in it. Modify this file to match your database credentials.

    manage.py - The famous manage.py script from django projects.

    main.py - This where we write codes. This is just a sample file to demonstrate how to import models.

    data - The data directory works as a django application and contains the models.py which is where you put your models according to django conventions

How to setup?

    git clone the source as a starting point
    Change to your project directory
    Create a new python3 virtualenv: python3 -m venv .env
    Activate the virtualenv: source .env/bin/activate
    Install Django: pip install django

How to use?

    Generate a new SECRET_KEY for your settings.py.
    Modify settings.py to add your database connection parameters.
    Open "data/models.py". Modify existing model or add your own.
    Run python manage.py makemigrations to make migration scripts
    Run python manage.py migrate to create the tables and sync db changes. Feel free to use other manage.py commands available for django orm.
    Every time you make changes to models or change db parameters, don't forget to run the migrations.
